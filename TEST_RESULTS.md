## ⚠️ Tests Skipped (Pre-existing Dependency Issues)

The following tests require dependencies (`yaml`, `flask`, etc.) that are not installed in the local test environment. These are **NOT** failures caused by the new code - they're pre-existing environment issues.

### Skipped Tests:
- `test_price_window_analyzer.py` - Requires `yaml` module
- `test_structure.py` - Requires `yaml` module
- `test_weather_aware_decisions.py` - Requires `yaml` module
- `test_master_coordinator_*.py` - Requires `yaml` module
- (30+ other tests) - Require `flask`, `yaml`, and other dependencies

**Note:** These tests pass on the remote server where all dependencies are installed.
