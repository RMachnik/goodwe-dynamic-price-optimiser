# Bug Fix Summary: Cost Calculation Correction

## Date: 2025-10-18

## Problem
Dashboard showed costs that were **1000x too low** due to double unit conversion.

## Root Cause
In `src/master_coordinator.py`:
- Line 623: `current_price` converted from PLN/MWh to PLN/kWh (÷1000)
- Line 654: Same `current_price` divided by 1000 **again** 
- **Result**: Costs were 1/1,000,000 of correct value

## Fix Applied

**File**: `src/master_coordinator.py`, Line 654-655

### Before (WRONG):
```python
estimated_cost_pln = energy_kwh * (current_price / 1000.0)  # Convert from PLN/MWh to PLN/kWh
```

### After (CORRECT):
```python
# current_price is already in PLN/kWh (converted on line 623)
estimated_cost_pln = energy_kwh * current_price
```

## Impact on Dashboard Values

### Before Fix (WRONG):
```
Total Cost: 0.04 PLN
Total Savings: 32.6 PLN
Savings %: 99.9%
Avg Cost/kWh: 0.001 PLN
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```
Total Cost: ~38 PLN
Total Savings: ~28 PLN
Savings %: ~42%
Avg Cost/kWh: ~0.55 PLN
```

## Other Files Checked

✅ **hybrid_charging_logic.py** - CORRECT (prices are in PLN/MWh, division by 1000 is needed)
✅ **multi_session_manager.py** - CORRECT (prices are in PLN/MWh, division by 1000 is needed)
✅ **price_window_analyzer.py** - CORRECT (works with PLN/MWh throughout)

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Deploy updated code to remote server
2. Wait for new charging decisions to be made
3. Check new decision files have correct `estimated_cost_pln` values
4. Verify dashboard shows realistic costs (energy_kwh × price should match stored cost)

## Expected Results After Fix

For a typical 5 kWh charge at 0.55 PLN/kWh:
- **Cost**: 2.75 PLN (not 0.0028 PLN)
- **Savings** vs 0.40 PLN/kWh baseline: Should be negative or small (paying more than baseline)
- **Avg cost/kWh**: Should match actual electricity rates (0.40-0.70 PLN/kWh range)

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Code fixed locally
- ⏳ Pending deployment to remote server (192.168.33.10)
- ⏳ Pending validation with real data
