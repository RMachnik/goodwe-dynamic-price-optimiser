# Advanced Optimization Rules Implementation

## Summary

Based on your feedback about the charging activity in the last 3 hours, I've implemented two advanced optimization rules to prevent expensive charging and enable proactive charging when conditions are favorable.

## Problem Analysis

**Your Charging Session (19:47-20:03):**
- **Battery Level**: 18% SOC (triggered critical charging)
- **Price Charged**: 1.577-1.694 PLN/kWh (very expensive!)
- **Better Price Available**: 0.468 PLN/kWh at 23:00 (only 3.5 hours later)
- **Savings Missed**: 72.4% savings by waiting
- **Cost Impact**: Charged at 3.4x the price that was available just hours later

## Implemented Optimization Rules

### Rule 1: Smart 10% SOC Handling
**Logic**: At exactly 10% SOC with high price (>0.8 PLN/kWh), always wait for price drop

**Configuration**:
```yaml
optimization_rules:
  wait_at_10_percent_if_high_price: true
  high_price_threshold_pln: 0.8  # PLN/kWh
```

**Behavior**:
- **12% SOC + 1.0 PLN/kWh**: Wait for better price (if weather allows)
- **12% SOC + 0.3 PLN/kWh**: Charge immediately (acceptable price)
- **11% SOC + 1.0 PLN/kWh**: Use normal critical logic (not exactly 12%)
- **12% SOC + 0.5 PLN/kWh + PV improving**: Wait for PV improvement (weather-aware)

### Rule 2: Proactive Charging
**Logic**: When PV is poor, weather won't improve, battery <80%, and price is not high → Charge proactively

**Configuration**:
```yaml
optimization_rules:
  proactive_charging_enabled: true
  pv_poor_threshold_w: 200      # PV power below this is poor
  battery_target_threshold: 80   # Charge proactively if below this %
  max_proactive_price_pln: 0.7  # Maximum price for proactive charging
```

**Conditions** (ALL must be met):
1. **PV Poor**: Current PV power < 200W
2. **Battery Low**: SOC < 80%
3. **Price Good**: Current price ≤ 0.7 PLN/kWh
4. **Weather Poor**: Weather won't improve significantly in next 6 hours

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **Configuration**: `config/master_coordinator_config.yaml`
   - Added `optimization_rules` section with all parameters

2. **Automated Price Charging**: `src/automated_price_charging.py`
   - Added `_check_proactive_charging_conditions()` method
   - Updated `_smart_critical_charging_decision()` with Rule 1
   - Added configuration loading for new parameters

3. **Hybrid Charging Logic**: `src/hybrid_charging_logic.py`
   - Updated thresholds to use new configuration values
   - Enhanced decision logic for smart critical charging

### Decision Flow

```
Battery Level Check:
├── ≤ 5% SOC → Emergency charging (always charge)
├── 6-12% SOC → Smart critical charging (weather-aware)
│   ├── Rule 1: 12% SOC + high price → Wait (if PV improving)
│   ├── Price ≤ 0.35 PLN/kWh → Charge immediately
│   ├── PV improving ≥2kW in 30min + price >0.4 PLN/kWh → Wait for PV
│   ├── Better price in ≤6h + ≥30% savings → Wait
│   └── Otherwise → Charge
├── 13-40% SOC → Normal logic + Rule 2
│   ├── Rule 2: PV poor + battery <80% + price ≤0.7 PLN/kWh → Proactive charge
│   └── Normal price analysis
└── >40% SOC → Normal logic only
```

## Test Results

All optimization rules tested successfully:

```
✓ Configuration loading test passed!
✓ Rule 1 logic: Would wait for price drop
✓ Rule 2 logic: All conditions met for proactive charging
✓ Real-world scenario: System would now wait for better price!
```

**Your Scenario Test**:
- **Input**: 18% SOC, 1.577 PLN/kWh, 0.468 PLN/kWh at 23:00
- **Savings**: 70.3%
- **Decision**: Wait for better price
- **Result**: Would save 70.3% on charging costs!

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Optimization
- **18% SOC + 1.577 PLN/kWh**: Charge immediately (expensive!)
- **Cost**: High electricity prices regardless of better options

### After Optimization
- **18% SOC + 1.577 PLN/kWh**: Wait for 0.468 PLN/kWh at 23:00
- **Savings**: 70.3% cost reduction
- **Logic**: Smart price awareness even at low battery levels

### Proactive Charging Examples
- **50% SOC + 100W PV + 0.5 PLN/kWh**: Proactive charge (conditions met)
- **50% SOC + 500W PV + 0.5 PLN/kWh**: Wait for PV (PV is good)
- **85% SOC + 100W PV + 0.5 PLN/kWh**: Wait (battery already high)
- **50% SOC + 100W PV + 0.8 PLN/kWh**: Wait for better price (price too high)

## Configuration Parameters

All parameters are configurable in `config/master_coordinator_config.yaml`:

```yaml
timing_awareness:
  smart_critical_charging:
    optimization_rules:
      # Rule 1: 10% SOC handling
      wait_at_10_percent_if_high_price: true
      high_price_threshold_pln: 0.8
      
      # Rule 2: Proactive charging
      proactive_charging_enabled: true
      pv_poor_threshold_w: 200
      battery_target_threshold: 80
      weather_improvement_hours: 6
      max_proactive_price_pln: 0.7
```

## Monitoring

The system will log detailed reasons for all decisions:

```
2025-09-08 19:47:11 - INFO - Critical battery (10%) but high price (1.000 PLN/kWh > 0.800 PLN/kWh) - waiting for price drop
2025-09-08 19:47:11 - INFO - Proactive charging: PV poor (100W < 200W), battery low (50% < 80%), price good (0.500 PLN/kWh ≤ 0.700 PLN/kWh), weather poor
```

## Benefits

1. **Cost Savings**: Prevents expensive charging when better prices are available soon
2. **Smart Timing**: Considers price trends and timing for optimal decisions
3. **Proactive Management**: Charges when conditions are favorable, not just when battery is low
4. **Battery Safety**: Maintains emergency override for truly critical levels (≤5%)
5. **Flexibility**: All parameters are configurable based on your preferences
6. **Transparency**: Detailed logging shows reasoning for every decision

## Next Steps

1. **Restart System**: Apply the new configuration
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for the new decision logic in action
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune thresholds based on your usage patterns
4. **Track Savings**: Monitor cost savings from the new optimization rules

The system will now make much smarter decisions about when to charge, potentially saving you significant money while maintaining battery safety and optimal energy management!
