**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## Overview

Successfully implemented full support for the Polish G13s seasonal electricity tariff with day-type awareness and Polish holiday detection.

---

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### 1. Polish Holiday Detection Module ✅
**File**: `src/utils/polish_holidays.py`

- ✅ Detects all 9 fixed Polish holidays (New Year, Epiphany, Labour Day, Constitution Day, etc.)
- ✅ Calculates movable holidays (Easter, Easter Monday, Pentecost, Corpus Christi) using Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm
- ✅ Detects weekends (Saturday, Sunday)
- ✅ Provides `is_free_day()` function for G13s tariff logic
- ✅ Includes holiday name lookup functionality
- ✅ Works across all years (2024, 2025, and beyond)

**Key Functions**:
- `is_polish_holiday(date)` - Checks if date is a Polish public holiday
- `is_weekend(date)` - Checks if date is Saturday or Sunday
- `is_free_day(date)` - Checks if date is weekend or holiday (G13s uses flat 0.110 PLN/kWh)
- `get_holiday_name(date)` - Returns holiday name in Polish and English

### 2. G13s Tariff Pricing Logic ✅
**File**: `src/tariff_pricing.py`

- ✅ Extended `TariffPricingCalculator` with G13s support
- ✅ Seasonal detection (Summer: Apr 1 - Sep 30, Winter: Oct 1 - Mar 31)
- ✅ Day-type detection (working days vs free days)
- ✅ Time zone detection with season-specific rules:
  - **Summer**: Morning peak (7-9h), Day off-peak (9-17h), Evening peak (17-21h), Night (21-7h)
  - **Winter**: Morning peak (7-10h), Day off-peak (10-15h), Evening peak (15-21h), Night (21-7h)
- ✅ Free day pricing (weekends/holidays: 0.110 PLN/kWh all hours)

**Distribution Prices**:
```
Working Days:
  Summer:
    - Day peak (7-9h, 17-21h): 0.290 PLN/kWh
    - Day off-peak (9-17h): 0.100 PLN/kWh
    - Night (21-7h): 0.110 PLN/kWh
  
  Winter:
    - Day peak (7-10h, 15-21h): 0.340 PLN/kWh
    - Day off-peak (10-15h): 0.200 PLN/kWh
    - Night (21-7h): 0.110 PLN/kWh

Free Days (Weekends & Holidays):
  - All hours: 0.110 PLN/kWh
```

### 3. Configuration ✅
**File**: `config/master_coordinator_config.yaml`

- ✅ Added complete G13s configuration with seasonal time zones
- ✅ Set G13s as **default tariff** (`tariff_type: "g13s"`)
- ✅ Includes detailed documentation in config comments
- ✅ Backward compatible with all existing tariffs (G11, G12, G12as, G12w, G14dynamic)

### 4. Comprehensive Tests ✅
**File**: `test/test_tariff_pricing_g13s.py`

- ✅ **19 tests created, all passing**
- ✅ Polish holiday detection (fixed and movable holidays for 2024 and 2025)
- ✅ Weekend detection
- ✅ Season detection (summer/winter boundaries)
- ✅ Time zone detection (summer vs winter hours)
- ✅ Distribution pricing for all scenarios (working days, weekends, holidays)
- ✅ Final price calculation validation
- ✅ Edge cases (midnight crossing, season boundaries, holiday on weekend)
- ✅ Realistic pricing scenarios

**Test Results**:
```
19 G13s tests: ✅ ALL PASSING
21 existing tariff tests: ✅ ALL PASSING
Total: 40/40 tariff tests passing (100%)
```

### 5. Documentation ✅
**File**: `docs/TARIFF_CONFIGURATION.md`

- ✅ Added comprehensive G13s section with:
  - Seasonal structure explanation
  - Distribution pricing tables
  - Time zone breakdown for summer/winter
  - Configuration examples
  - Example pricing calculations
  - Best charging times recommendations
  - Troubleshooting guide

**File**: `README.md`
- ✅ Updated to mention G13s as default tariff
- ✅ Lists all supported tariff types

## 🎯 Key Features

### Seasonal Awareness
- Automatically detects summer (Apr-Sep) vs winter (Oct-Mar)
- Applies correct pricing based on season
- Different time zones for each season

### Day-Type Awareness
- Detects working days vs free days (weekends/holidays)
- Free days use flat 0.110 PLN/kWh (cheapest rate)
- Automatic Polish holiday detection

### Time Zone Optimization
- **Summer best times**: Night (21-7h), Day off-peak (9-17h)
- **Winter best times**: Night (21-7h)
- **Avoid**: Peak hours (especially winter peaks at 0.340 PLN/kWh)

### Cost Savings Potential
- Summer day off-peak: 0.100 PLN/kWh (65% cheaper than peak)
- Night charging: 0.110 PLN/kWh (year-round)
- Weekend/holiday: 0.110 PLN/kWh (67% cheaper than winter peak)

## 🔧 Usage

### System is Ready
No configuration changes needed! The system is already configured with G13s as the default tariff.

### Verify Configuration
```bash
# Check current tariff
grep "tariff_type" config/master_coordinator_config.yaml
# Should show: tariff_type: "g13s"
```

### Monitor Pricing Decisions
The system will automatically:
- Detect season (summer/winter)
- Check if date is free day (weekend/holiday)
- Apply correct time zone pricing
- Log pricing decisions with full breakdown

### Switch to Different Tariff (Optional)
Edit `config/master_coordinator_config.yaml`:
```yaml
electricity_tariff:
  tariff_type: "g12w"  # or "g11", "g12", "g12as", "g14dynamic"
```
