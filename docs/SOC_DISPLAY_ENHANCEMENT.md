# SOC Display and Blocking Reason Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## Overview

Enhanced the charging decision display and logging system to prominently show SOC (State of Charge) at the moment of decision creation, and provide detailed reasoning for blocked charging decisions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Web Dashboard Enhancements (`src/log_web_server.py`)

#### SOC Display
- **Prominent SOC Badge**: Added color-coded SOC badge to all decision cards
  - 🔋 Icon for blocked decisions
  - ⚡ Icon for executed decisions
  - Color coding: Red (<20%), Yellow (20-50%), Green (>50%)
  
#### Enhanced Blocking Reasons
Improved blocking reason detection and display with specific categories:
- **Kompas Peak Hours**:
  - REQUIRED REDUCTION (code 3): "Grid charging blocked during peak hours"
  - RECOMMENDED SAVING (code 2): "Deferred to reduce load"
- **Price Conditions**: "Price threshold not met"
- **Safety Conditions**: Battery safety margin, grid voltage, emergency stops
- **Communication**: Errors, timeouts, connection issues
- **System State**: Already charging, PV overproduction

#### Visual Improvements
- SOC displayed in a colored badge below the decision reason
- Blocking reasons shown in red text for blocked decisions
- Better visual hierarchy for decision status

### 2. Master Coordinator Logging (`src/master_coordinator.py`)

#### Enhanced Decision Execution Logging
All decision execution methods now include SOC:

```python
# Before
logger.info("Executing decision: Start charging")

# After
logger.info(f"Executing decision: Start charging at SOC {battery_soc}%")
```

#### Enhanced Peak Hours Blocking
Added detailed logging for peak hours policy blocking:

```python
logger.warning(f"🚫 Kompas REQUIRED REDUCTION: Blocking grid charging (SOC: {battery_soc}%, Peak hours code 3)")
logger.warning(f"   Reason: Required reduction period - grid charging not allowed regardless of price or battery level")
```

#### Methods Updated
- `_execute_smart_decision()`: Added SOC to all log messages
- `_execute_decision()`: Added SOC for all action types
- `_apply_peak_hours_policy()`: Enhanced with SOC and detailed blocking reasons

### 3. Charging Controller Logging (`src/automated_price_charging.py`)

#### Enhanced `start_price_based_charging()`
- Retrieves battery SOC before making decisions
- Logs SOC for all outcomes:
  - Already charging: `"Already charging at SOC {battery_soc}%"`
  - Blocked: `"🚫 Charging blocked: Current price is not optimal (SOC: {battery_soc}%)"`
  - Starting: `"⚡ Starting charging due to validated decision (SOC: {battery_soc}%)"`
  - Success: `"✅ Charging started successfully at SOC {battery_soc}%"`
  - Failure: `"❌ Failed to start charging at SOC {battery_soc}%"`

## Example Output

### Before Implementation

**Dashboard:**
```
23:47:44 - Charge
Aggressive charging during cheapest price period
✅ EXECUTED
Energy: 2.20 kWh | Cost: 0.94 PLN | Savings: 0.00 PLN
```

**Logs:**
```
2025-10-21 14:32:15 INFO Executing decision: Start charging
2025-10-21 14:32:15 INFO Starting charging due to emergency battery level
```

### After Implementation

**Dashboard:**
```
23:47:44 - Charge
Aggressive charging during cheapest price period
⚡ 65%
✅ EXECUTED
Energy: 2.20 kWh | Cost: 0.94 PLN | Savings: 0.00 PLN
```

**Logs (Executed):**
```
2025-10-21 23:47:44 INFO Executing decision: Start charging at SOC 65%
2025-10-21 23:47:44 INFO Decision validated by engine (SOC: 65%)
2025-10-21 23:47:44 INFO ⚡ Starting charging due to validated decision (SOC: 65%, overriding price check)
2025-10-21 23:47:44 INFO ✅ Charging started successfully at SOC 65%
```

**Logs (Blocked):**
```
2025-10-21 14:32:15 INFO Executing decision: Start charging at SOC 45%
2025-10-21 14:32:15 WARNING 🚫 Kompas REQUIRED REDUCTION: Blocking grid charging (SOC: 45%, Peak hours code 3)
2025-10-21 14:32:15 WARNING    Reason: Required reduction period - grid charging not allowed regardless of price or battery level
2025-10-21 14:32:15 WARNING Charging execution blocked at SOC 45% - See charging controller logs for details
```

**Dashboard (Blocked):**
```
14:32:15 - Charge
Charging recommended but blocked
🔋 45%
🚫 BLOCKED
Kompas REQUIRED REDUCTION - Grid charging blocked during peak hours (SOC: 45%)
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
1. **Immediate Context**: SOC visible at a glance for every decision
2. **Clear Blocking Reasons**: Understand why charging was blocked without digging through logs
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded SOC badges provide quick status assessment

### Debugging & Analysis
1. **Better Log Context**: Every log message includes SOC for correlation
2. **Detailed Blocking Reasons**: Easy to identify and resolve blocking conditions
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into decision-making process

### Monitoring
1. **Quick Health Checks**: Spot unusual battery behavior patterns
2. **Policy Verification**: Confirm peak hours policies are working correctly
3. **Performance Tracking**: Correlate decisions with battery state over time

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ All web dashboard tests passing (8/8)
- ✅ All master coordinator tests passing (21/21)
- ✅ All peak hours policy tests passing (3/3)
- ✅ No linter errors introduced

### Validation
- SOC display works correctly for all decision types
- Blocking reasons properly detected and displayed
- Enhanced logging doesn't impact performance
- Backwards compatible with existing decision files

---

## Technical Details

### SOC Retrieval
- Retrieved from `current_data['battery']['soc_percent']`
- Falls back gracefully if data unavailable
- Async retrieval in charging controller for real-time accuracy

### Color Coding Logic
```javascript
const getSocColor = (soc) => {
    if (soc < 20) return '#dc3545'; // Red - Critical
    if (soc < 50) return '#ffc107'; // Yellow - Low
    return '#28a745'; // Green - Good
};
```

### Blocking Reason Detection
Uses pattern matching on decision reason field:
- Case-insensitive substring matching
- Priority-based matching (most specific first)
- Includes SOC in all blocking messages

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **SOC Trend Indicators**: Show if SOC is rising/falling
2. **Historical SOC Charts**: Plot SOC over time on decision timeline
3. **SOC-Based Alerts**: Notify when decisions blocked at critical SOC levels
4. **Prediction Display**: Show expected SOC after charging completion

### Additional Metrics
- Show charging rate (W) alongside SOC
- Display estimated time to full charge
- Add temperature information for battery health
