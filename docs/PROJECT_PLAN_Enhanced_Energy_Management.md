### **✅ IMPLEMENTED - Advanced Optimization Rules**

The system now includes advanced optimization rules based on real-world charging analysis and cost optimization:

#### **Smart Critical Charging**
- **Emergency Threshold**: 5% SOC (always charge regardless of price)
- **Critical Threshold**: 10% SOC (price-aware charging)
- **Rule 1**: At exactly 10% SOC with high price (>0.8 PLN/kWh), always wait for price drop
- **Rule 2**: Proactive charging when PV is poor (<200W) + battery <80% + price ≤0.7 PLN/kWh + weather poor

#### **Cost Optimization Results**
- **Real-world scenario**: 18% SOC + 1.577 PLN/kWh → Now waits for 0.468 PLN/kWh (70.3% savings)
- **Prevents expensive charging**: Avoids charging at high prices when better prices are available soon
- **Proactive management**: Charges when conditions are favorable, not just when battery is low

#### **Configuration Parameters**
```yaml
smart_critical_charging:
  optimization_rules:
    wait_at_10_percent_if_high_price: true
    high_price_threshold_pln: 0.8

### **✅ IMPLEMENTED - Weather-Aware PV Forecasting & Analysis**

The system now includes comprehensive weather-aware PV forecasting and analysis with the following features:

#### **PV Overproduction Detection**
- **Threshold**: 500W overproduction (configurable via `pv_overproduction_threshold_w`)
- **Logic**: When PV production > house consumption + 500W, grid charging is avoided
- **Priority**: Overrides normal scoring logic to prevent unnecessary grid charging

#### **PV Deficit Analysis**
- **Threshold**: 1000W deficit with battery SOC ≤ 40%
- **Logic**: Triggers urgent charging when PV is insufficient for consumption
- **Priority**: Overrides normal scoring to ensure system reliability

#### **Enhanced Scoring Algorithm**
- **PV Score Calculation**: Now considers net power (PV - Consumption) instead of PV alone
- **Scoring Logic**:
  - PV Overproduction (net > 500W): Score = 0 (no grid charging needed)
  - PV Deficit (net < 0): Score = 60-100 (urgent charging needed)
  - PV Balanced (0 < net < 500W): Score = 10-50 (normal operation)

#### **Decision Priority Order**
1. **Critical Battery** (SOC ≤ 20%): Charge immediately (highest priority)
2. **PV Overproduction**: Avoid grid charging
3. **PV Deficit**: Start charging if significant deficit + low battery
4. **Normal Scoring**: Use weighted multi-factor scoring

#### **Weather-Aware PV Trend Analysis**
- **PV Trend Detection**: Analyzes PV production trends (increasing/decreasing/stable) for next 1-2 hours
- **Weather Integration**: Uses IMGW + Open-Meteo weather data to enhance PV forecasting
- **Smart Timing Logic**: Decides whether to wait for PV improvement or charge from grid immediately
- **Trend Strength Calculation**: Uses linear regression to determine trend direction and strength
- **Weather Impact Analysis**: Considers cloud cover and solar irradiance trends

#### **Smart "Wait vs Charge" Decision Logic**
- **Wait Conditions**: 
  - PV production is increasing with >60% confidence
  - Expected PV improvement >1kW within 2 hours
  - Not in very low price window
  - Battery level >20% (not critical)
- **Charge Now Conditions**:
  - PV production is decreasing
  - Very low electricity prices (<10th percentile)
  - Critical battery level (≤20%)
  - No significant PV improvement expected

#### **Weather-Enhanced Decision Process**
1. **PV Trend Analysis**: Analyze PV forecast trends using weather data
2. **Timing Recommendation**: Determine if waiting for PV improvement is beneficial
3. **Price Window Analysis**: Consider current and future electricity prices
4. **Battery State Check**: Ensure battery safety and critical level handling
5. **Final Decision**: Apply weather-aware timing recommendations

#### **Configuration**
```yaml
pv_consumption_analysis:
  pv_overproduction_threshold_w: 500  # Minimum excess PV to avoid grid charging

weather_aware_decisions:
  enabled: true                # Enable weather-aware charging decisions

**Example**:
- **Current Time**: 11:00 AM
- **Low Price Window**: 11:00-15:00 (4 hours of cheap electricity)
- **Current PV**: 2 kW (insufficient for fast charging)
- **Battery Capacity**: 10 kWh
- **Battery Current**: 30% (3 kWh needed to reach 60%)
- **Charging Rate**: 3 kW (from inverter)
- **Time to Charge**: 3 kWh ÷ 3 kW = 1 hour
- **PV Forecast**: PV will increase to 5 kW at 13:00 (2 hours from now)

**Decision**: Should we wait for PV or charge from grid now?

### **Optimal Solution: Hybrid Charging Strategy**

#### **Timing-Aware Charging Logic**

```python
def analyze_charging_timing(self, current_data, price_data, pv_forecast):
    """
    Analyze whether to charge from grid during low price windows
    when PV won't be sufficient to complete charging before price increases
    """
    
    # Get current conditions
    current_price = self.get_current_price(price_data)
    low_price_threshold = self.get_low_price_threshold(price_data)
    battery_soc = current_data['battery']['soc_percent']
    battery_capacity = 10.0  # kWh
    charging_rate = 3.0  # kW (from inverter)
    
    # Calculate charging needs
    target_soc = 60.0  # Target SOC
    energy_needed = (target_soc - battery_soc) / 100 * battery_capacity
    time_to_charge = energy_needed / charging_rate  # hours
    
    # Check if we're in a low price window
    if current_price <= low_price_threshold:
        low_price_end = self.get_low_price_window_end(price_data)
        time_remaining = (low_price_end - datetime.now()).total_seconds() / 3600
        
        # Critical decision point
        if time_remaining < time_to_charge:
            # PV won't be able to complete charging before price increases
            return self.decide_hybrid_charging(current_data, price_data, pv_forecast)
    
    return "wait_for_pv"
```

#### **Hybrid Charging Decision Matrix**

| Scenario | PV Available | Price Window | Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Low Price + Insufficient PV Time** | < 3 kW | < 2 hours remaining | **Grid Charge Now** | Capture cheap electricity before price increases |
| **Low Price + Sufficient PV Time** | > 3 kW | > 2 hours remaining | **Wait for PV** | Let PV handle charging during cheap period |
| **High Price + PV Available** | > 2 kW | High price | **PV Only** | Avoid expensive grid charging |
| **High Price + No PV** | < 1 kW | High price | **Wait** | Don't charge during expensive periods |

#### **Implementation Strategy**

**1. Real-time PV Forecasting**
```python
def forecast_pv_production(self, hours_ahead: int = 4) -> List[float]:
    """
    Forecast PV production for next 4 hours
    Based on historical patterns, weather data, and current conditions
    """
    # Use historical PV data + weather forecast
    # Return hourly PV production predictions
    pass
```

**2. Price Window Analysis**
```python
def analyze_price_windows(self, price_data: Dict) -> List[PriceWindow]:
    """
    Identify low price windows and their duration
    """
    windows = []
    current_price = self.get_current_price(price_data)
    threshold = self.get_low_price_threshold(price_data)
    
    if current_price <= threshold:
        # Find when price increases above threshold
        end_time = self.find_price_increase_time(price_data)
        windows.append(PriceWindow(
            start=datetime.now(),
            end=end_time,
            duration=(end_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds() / 3600,
            avg_price=current_price
        ))
    
    return windows
```

**3. Hybrid Charging Logic**
```python
def decide_hybrid_charging(self, current_data, price_data, pv_forecast):
    """
    Decide whether to use grid charging during low price windows
    when PV timing is insufficient
    """
    
    # Calculate energy needed and time required
    energy_needed = self.calculate_energy_needed(current_data)
    time_to_charge = energy_needed / self.charging_rate
    
    # Get low price window duration
    price_window = self.analyze_price_windows(price_data)[0]
    time_remaining = price_window.duration
    
    # Critical decision: Can PV complete charging before price increases?
    if time_remaining < time_to_charge:
        # PV won't finish in time - use grid charging
        savings = self.calculate_savings(current_data, price_data)
        
        if savings > self.minimum_savings_threshold:
            return {
                'action': 'start_grid_charging',
                'reason': f'Low price window ({time_remaining:.1f}h) shorter than charging time ({time_to_charge:.1f}h)',
                'savings': savings,
                'charging_source': 'grid',
                'duration': min(time_remaining, time_to_charge)
            }
    
    return {
        'action': 'wait_for_pv',
        'reason': 'PV will complete charging before price increases',
        'charging_source': 'pv',
        'estimated_completion': datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=time_to_charge)
    }
```

### **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **💰 Maximum Savings**: Capture cheap electricity before price increases
2. **⚡ Optimal Timing**: Don't miss low price windows due to PV timing
3. **🔄 Hybrid Strategy**: Use both PV and grid optimally
