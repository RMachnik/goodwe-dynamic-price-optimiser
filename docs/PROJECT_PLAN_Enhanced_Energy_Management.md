## 💡 **Key Strategy Changes from Recent Discussion**

### **✅ CRITICAL: Monitoring Logic Fix Completed (COMPLETED)**
- **Problem**: Current `--monitor` fetched D+1 prices every 15 minutes (inefficient!)
- **Solution**: Replaced with scheduled charging based on known optimal windows
- **Impact**: Eliminated redundant API calls, improved efficiency
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### **✅ Polish Electricity Pricing Implementation (COMPLETED)**
- **SC Component Added**: Market price + 0.0892 zł/kWh (Składnik cenotwórczy) ✅
- **Accurate Price Calculations**: All algorithms now use final prices (market + SC) ✅
- **Configuration-Based**: SC component configurable in fast_charge_config.yaml ✅
- **Distribution cost ignored**: Fixed rate (0.3508 zł/kWh) doesn't affect decisions
- **G12 time zones**: Optional for analysis only, no impact on charging logic

### **🎯 Core Charging Decision Factors (UPDATED)**
1. **Price Factor (35% weight)**: Only charge during low prices (25th percentile of FINAL prices)
2. **PV vs. Consumption (30% weight)**: Only charge when PV can't cover consumption
3. **Battery State (20% weight)**: Strategic charging based on SoC levels
4. **Weather Forecast (15% weight)**: **NEW** - Weather-aware charging decisions

### **⏰ Timing Strategy (NEW)**
- **13:00-14:00 CET Retry Window**: Multiple attempts to fetch new D+1 prices
- **Retry Logic**: Check every 10-15 minutes between 13:00-14:00 CET
- **Same-Day Planning**: Plan charging for tomorrow based on available prices
- **Real-Time Execution**: Execute charging decisions based on current conditions
- **Data Availability**: CSDAC prices for D+1 available on day D around 12:40
- **Robustness**: System continues working even if publication is delayed

### **⚡ Multi-Session Daily Charging**
- **Multiple charging windows**: 3-4 sessions per day based on low prices
- **Short sessions**: 15-45 minutes during very low prices
- **Medium sessions**: 1-2 hours during low prices
- **Long sessions**: 2-4 hours during extremely low prices

### **🔋 Battery Management Strategy**
- **Critical (0-20%)**: Charge immediately if price is low
- **Low (20-40%)**: Charge during low prices
- **Medium (40-70%)**: Charge during very low prices only
- **High (70-90%)**: Charge during extremely low prices only

### **⚡ Smart Charging Source Selection (NEW)**
**Your Specific Case Implementation:**
- **Low Energy Cost** ✅ (already implemented)
- **Good PV Generation** ✅ (monitoring implemented, forecasting needed)
- **Low House Usage** ✅ (monitoring implemented, forecasting using 7-day averages)
- **Weather Consideration** ❌ (needs implementation)

**Decision Logic:**
1. **PV Charging Preferred** when:
   - Energy cost is low (25th percentile)
   - PV generation is good (>2kW)
   - House usage is low (<1kW average from last 7 days)
   - Weather forecast shows stable conditions

2. **Grid Charging Preferred** when:
   - Energy cost is low AND weather forecast shows deterioration
   - PV generation is insufficient to meet house demand
   - Battery needs immediate charging for critical levels

3. **Hybrid Approach** when:
   - Partial PV charging + grid top-up during low prices
   - Weather conditions are variable

### **📊 House Usage Forecasting Implementation (NEW)**
**7-Day Historical Average Method:**
```python
def forecast_house_usage(self, target_hour: int, target_day_type: str) -> float:
    """
    Forecast house usage for specific hour using last 7 days average
    - target_hour: Hour of day (0-23)
    - target_day_type: 'weekday' or 'weekend'
    Returns: Predicted usage in kW
    """
    # Get historical data for same hour from last 7 days
    # Calculate average usage for same day type (weekday/weekend)
    # Apply seasonal adjustments if available
    # Return forecasted usage
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data Source**: Historical consumption data from `enhanced_data_collector.py`
- **Time Window**: Last 7 days of data
- **Granularity**: Hourly averages
- **Day Type Recognition**: Weekday vs Weekend patterns
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Monthly trend analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Data quality assessment

**Usage in Charging Decisions:**
- **Low Usage Threshold**: <1kW average (prefer PV charging)
- **Medium Usage Threshold**: 1-3kW average (hybrid approach)
- **High Usage Threshold**: >3kW average (grid charging preferred)

- **Planning Window**: 13:00-14:00 CET retry window with fallback to previous day
- **Real-Time Execution**: Current prices used for immediate charging decisions
- **Data Freshness**: Prices updated daily, not real-time during the day
- **Optimization Strategy**: Plan tomorrow's charging based on available prices (new or previous day)
- **Robustness**: System continues working even if publication is delayed
- **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts between 13:00-14:00 CET to handle delays

#### **Detailed Retry Strategy:**
- **13:00 CET**: First attempt to fetch new D+1 prices
- **13:15 CET**: Second attempt if first failed
- **13:30 CET**: Third attempt if second failed
- **13:45 CET**: Fourth attempt if third failed
