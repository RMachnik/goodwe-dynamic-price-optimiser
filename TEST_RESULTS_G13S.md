## Warnings Analysis

The test suite shows 94 warnings, which are:
- **Non-Critical**: Deprecation warnings from existing async test code
- **Pre-Existing**: These warnings existed before G13s implementation
- **No Impact**: Tests still pass, functionality unaffected

**Warning Types**:
1. RuntimeWarning: Coroutine not awaited (async test setup issues)
2. DeprecationWarning: Test returns value instead of None
3. PytestReturnNotNoneWarning: Some tests return bool

**Action**: These are in existing test files and don't affect G13s functionality or any production code.
